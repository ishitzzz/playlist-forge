# Mission Accomplished - Navigation & Polish

I have successfully added the requested navigation controls:

1.  **Generate Local Videos**: I've ensured that the "Generate New" action returns you to the **Upload Phase**, keeping your previous Level/Language settings intact but ready for a new syllabus.
2.  **Back to Home**: Added a subtle, aesthetic **`← BACK`** button on the Upload screen, allowing you to return to the onboarding/home screen if you need to change your persona.

The UI remains consistent with your font-mono/serif design language.

## Next Steps
All major features seem complete! The engine is intelligent, robust, and the UI is polished.
